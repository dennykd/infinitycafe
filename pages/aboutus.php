            <h1>What makes our coffee special?</h1>
            <p>I wanted to take this time to let you know how grateful we are to have you choosing us for your coffee needs. Quality coffee is a passion for me and I am so thankful for your patronage which allows me to do this. I wanted to share a little about our coffees, and why I think they are so special</p>
            <p>we buy our coffee from only the most reputable farms and mills in Banyuwangi, We buy only from reputable farmers and millers at volumes equal to several hundred acres. We grade our coffees into different sizes and quality</p>
            <p>throw out the lower quality beans and blind taste our grades and types individually to find the best roasting temperature that bring out the best taste for that specific size and coffee bean – different roasting temperatures for different coffee. We do this constantly to maintain a consistent and high-quality roast every time. 
  </p>
            <p>As you may have already experienced, you don't have to add cream and sweetener to drink our coffee – it has a smoother and less acidic taste without cream because of this aging process. You may have waited a bit longer for your coffee but we can guarantee you received the freshest coffee anywhere.</p>
